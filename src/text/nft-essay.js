        As soon as Kenny Schachter appears on screen for our scheduled call, I knew I was going to enjoy our conversation. It feels funny admitting him from my zoom ‘waiting room’ into my ‘personal meeting room,’ as I sit in the undigested mess of my Providence college apartment and he in his what I imagine to be very posh and expensive Manhattan home, filled with Mary Heilmann chairs and Peter Hujar prints.  He is one of those people I meet and have a gut instinct will be easy to talk to. Within a minute into our call, I’m alone again in my zoom room. He’s left to check on the auction for his collaborative piece with Jerry Saltz, listed on the digital art marketplace Super Rare that’s about to end. It’s a collage tapestry of Jerry’s Instagram posts from March 2012 to April 21st, minted on the blockchain as a non-fungible token (NFT), called the First 10,000.  It’s a reference to Beeple’s <i>the First 5,000 Days </i> which sold for $69.3 million on Christie’s a little over a month ago.  The piece reminds me of a crossover between Richard Prince’s Instagram canvases (although far less narcissistic) and one of those photo tapestry’s where you walk out, and it reveals a larger constructed image of George Bush. Ten thousand Instagram posts is a lot – that’s roughly three posts per day for the past nine years. The timing is so impeccable that I wouldn’t hesitate to believe if it was premeditated in some master plan hatched by Jerry and Kenny.

        </p>

        Kenny Schacter is many things. Amongst others he’s an artist, a writer, a curator, and a collector. When he writes, he’s professionally unhinged in the way that only people who’ve made it can afford. In a recent NFT article he wrote for Artnet, he calls David Gerard ‘the NFT antichrist’ in response to Gerard’s latest book, the Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain.  Like me, he’s an NFT maximalist and has been very vocally adamant that they are here to stay.

        <p>

        For those who are completely oblivious to what I’m talking about, you might be living under a rock. In the past two months NFTs have received an extraordinary amount of media coverage, from articles in the New York Times and the New Yorker, to even an SNL skit called “What the Hell’s an NFT?” that SNL made into an NFT days later and sold for 172 Eth (currently $430 thousand).  It’s easiest to think of them as digital objects that comes with a deed of ownership. They’re minted on the blockchain and can be kept and transferred between digital wallets. Like any physical asset you own, a car or your house, you can auction NFTs on marketplaces or sell them directly to others.

        </p>
        <p>

        It is hard to grasp the concept of a non-fungible token. Non-fungible means that the objects aren’t interchangeable, you can’t easily redeem an NFT on a crypto exchange for another asset like you can Bitcoin or Ethereum (which are fungible tokens). NFTs can be anything, really, the most common forms ranging from digital art to videos to trading card collectibles. Some NFTs are so indiscriminate that you can’t help but wonder who would even want to own them. You can now bid on a limited edition photography collection of former Seattle Seahawk’s running back Marshawn Lynch’s collaboration with Dodi blunts or Brazzer’s one-of-one collectible lollipops featuring your favorite porn star.   Some NFT collectibles with the largest market caps are Cryptopunks, 24x24 pixel cartoon portraits inspired by the London punk scene, the cheapest selling for $50 thousand.  Christie’s recently listed nine of them for auction. Others include NBA Top Shot (partnered with the NBA) , which releases collectible NBA moments and Zed Run, a platform where users can breed, race, and bet on digital TRON-esque horses.  There’s a complex system built in of generational breeding, genotype purity, and bloodline scarcity. Most importantly, people are pumping these projects with money – massive amounts of money. The most expensive sales respectively to date have been a moment of Lebron James selling for $280,000 and a Nakamoto-breed horse sold for $125,000. Aside from collectibles, the other booming NFT market has been digital artwork. In late February a piece by the digital artist Beeple sold on the site Nifty Gateway for $6.6 million, breaking the record for the most expensive digital artwork ever sold. The 10-secnond clip portrayed a digitally rendered Donald Trump covered in slogans, collapsed on a grassy lawn as pedestrians walked by. Nearly two months later, he broke his prior record over ten-fold with his Christie’s listing.

        </p>
        <p>

        Owning an NFT doesn’t give you commercial rights – most aren’t even exclusive content that can’t be found elsewhere on the internet. To many, the idea is confounding. You might ask: why would one pay thousands of dollars for an image or a video clip that can be viewed at any time on Instagram or YouTube? But then again, the same can be said about traditional artwork. Why pay tens of thousands for a Stephen Shore print or a Picasso when you can just as easily print them on canvas or photographic printing paper for less than twenty bucks?

        </p>
        <p>

        Kenny’s an artist who entered the scene on the earlier, releasing his first NFT collection with Nifty Gateway back in November. Nifty Gateway along with Super Rare and MakersPlace are marketplaces that team up with artists to curate limited edition releases.  Back then, Nifty released a collection once a week. Now, there seems to be fifteen different drops each day, with a long line of artists trying to score a collaboration. Kenny was placed on a several month waitlist for his next drop. He’s minted a lot of NFT’s and you can view most of them on his profile on OpenSeas.  One features a Jeff Koons balloon dog sculpture standing on a hill overlooking a favela. Another features a short screen recording from his iPhone of him deleting the audio-chat app Clubhouse. During our conversation I called him a normie for using Clubhouse and he told me he made that NFT after a stranger in a chatroom called him a racist. We talked about the hypocrisy of the masses and the public outcry at the energy consumption required to mint an NFT.

        </p>
        <p>

        “No one’s talked about the energy usage of oil paint or stretchers for canvases or single-use shipping containers or a gigantic Kaws sculpture made of say endangered trees.”

        </p>
        <p>

        I explained to him the concept of an Instagram infographic and how the online herd mentality contributes to the dissemination of unreliable information. Sometime last year there was public outcry surrounding a post cancelling Google and Apple for taking Palestine off their map services.  The State of Palestine has never been on either Google or Apple maps.

        </p>
        <p>

        “I went to Ghana to write a feature for GQ magazine and immediately thought everything I did in my life was senseless and immoral. You have this stupid recreation of this children’s entertainment thing – dog – and to put that in context of pervasive property takes on an altogether different meaning. So that piece reflecting a favela means a lot different than reflecting a collector in an auction house or their front garden in Greenwich Connecticut.”

        </p>
        <p>

        Some of my other favorites minted by Kenny include an image of a green grape with a face drawn on in sharpie titled “what’s eating gilbert grape.” Another is an edited video of a user visiting Pornhub and searching “Special: Pornhub goes Fine Art! We teamed up with a LA Art Gallery and Commissioned Feminist Art Porn. It can’t get better than that! Here’s ‘The Pleasure Principle.”’ What follows is a poorly photoshopped montage of people I assume to be in the art world over porn actors mixed to ‘Where are you baby?’ by Betty Boo. Michele Maccarone receives the greatest amount of screen time.

        </p>
        <p>

        This turned out to be a real event. In 2019, Pornhub commissioned an exhibit at LA’s Maccarone gallery called ‘The Pleasure Principle’ featuring an expansive list of female artists including names such as Louise Bourgeois. Pornhub described the exhibition as “dismantling the art/porn binary, positing arousal as a universal goal, transcending boundaries that separate the sexual from the aesthetic, the surreal from the sensible, the occult from the mainstream.”  Kenny’s video ends in an image of Maccarone with a speech bubble that reads in all caps, “Get F*cked twice!! Watch the videos then buy one of these paintings! 15% discount for pornhubbers!”

        </p>
        <p>

        I ask Kenny if he thinks NFTs will be around to stay, or if people are just hopping on the trend to make a quick buck.

        </p>
        <p>

        “I think even Jerry got sucked into the idea of unlimited wealth, it’s something irresistible to even the purest – I mean I’m surprised some priest or reverend or nun hasn’t started - Mother Theresa would’ve been minting NFT’s if she was alive,” Kenny says, then as if to make a note to himself he mutters, “I should make a fucking Mother Theresa NFT.”

        </p>
        <p>

        Kenny and Jerry aren’t making any money off their auction. Originally, they had planned to keep 10% of the profit and donate 90% but now 100% is of proceeds are being donated to Memorial Sloan Kettering and the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. Kenny keeps complaining about how Jerry’s the one who roped him into all this, and now he isn’t even getting paid a pretty penny, but I can tell he doesn’t really mind.

        I spoke to Danny Adkins, a co-founder behind the website MomentRanks, one of the leading websites that help collectors of NBA Top Shot appraise their collection and track its market value. Adkins has been closely following crypto and blockchain since he was in eighth grade, when people still used thousands of bitcoins to pay for their pizza. As we call, the rest of his team is working around the clock to roll out their new features in time for the NBA All Star game next weekend.

        “I view this as the first mainstream push for decentralization of the internet. People are finally socializing through alternative channels in doing trade and content creation. It’s a rebellion against the centralized control of the internet that taken shape over the last fifteen years.” We talk a bit about the NBA and trading cards before I bring up the topic of tokenization of digital artwork and its monetization, whether it’s a bubble that’s bound to burst.

        </p>
        <p>

        “I’ve been around the block long enough to know that things are definitely hyped and over-inflated at the moment. The market’s due for a correction, but I think there is the added aspect of mass accessibility. It’s paving the way for future applications that will actually be useful.”
        </p>
        <p>
        He tells me the “gimmick,” so-to-speak, of NFT’s is that with blockchain there is a built-in license of ownership and a public ledger of all transactions. It attempts to tackle one of the image’s inherent qualities in the digital era: infinite distribution and authority of likeness. Currently on the web, if an image you post is replicated and redistributed, after several iterations it becomes extremely difficult for other users to trace back to the original content. There’s no cost for another user to take your image and share it under their domain. Using Google’s reverse image search, Dorothea Lange’s “Migrant Mother” photograph pings over six hundred separate websites. In the case of NFT’s, each is an object that has an associated cost to be placed on the blockchain (the computational cost of minting), that provide a public proof of ownership. It’s important to note that this doesn’t stop the metadata (whatever digital content is attached to the NFT) from circulating the internet, but instead provides a mechanism to clearly distinguish copies from an original along with a codified trail that leads back to it.
        </p>
        <p>
        The conundrum for many is that the monetary value of tokenized images seems to arise from thin air. This fails to take into account, that engagement creates revenue. Most centralized internet platforms we use to view these images and other media have commodified content to have users believe that views and likes are rewards in it of themselves. Every time content is retweeted, redistributed, reformatted, it leads to increased user engagement which results in profits for the parent company, none of which trickle back to the original creator. NFTs are beginning to provide original content creators with the opportunity to monetize their past creations. This has become extremely prevalent regarding landmarks and milestones in the history of social media. In the past two weeks, examples of this have been the creator of Nyan Cat tokenizing the gif and selling it for over $600,000, the original trollface selling for $7,000, the pixel deal-with-it sunglass gif selling for $27,000. The most iconic (and expensive) example of this is perhaps Jack Dorsey, the founder Twitter, tokenizing his first tweet which reads “just setting up my twittr” and auctioning it. The current highest bid is $2.5 million.
        </p>
        <p>
        Adkins agrees with me that the meteoric rise we’ve seen in collecting NFTs can be partly attributed to the pandemic, how it has deprived us of the familiar capitalist pleasures of purchasing and being seen with our recent acquisitions – a new outfit, a new coffee table, the new painting on the wall. While we quarantine, the possessions we would normally flaunt in person at dinner parties have been relegated to internet showcases and our Animal Crossing Islands. Having a thriving market where creators could directly engage with other creators and collectors seems to carve out a new space on the internet to socialize and engage with one another through content and trade.
        </p>
        <p>
        On the surface, it seems like sites such as Super Rare are providing artists and creators an alternative marketplace where they can sell their work directly to collectors, circumventing the current institutional dredges of dealers, agents, and galleries. The delegation of power returning to the individuals who are generating the form of capital can even be read from a Marxist standpoint. Once an NFT artwork leaves the hands of the creator, ten percent of each resale in the future trickles back to the artist. However, upon a closer analysis, there is an unnerving quality to the mimesis of NFT artwork in relation to the existing system.
        </p>
        <p>
        While I find it amazing that certain digital artists are finally being recognized and are receiving handsome sums for their work, it seems rather than become more accessible, the marketplace for NFT artwork is instead morphing into a digital clone of the existing, tactile, pop art market. Fine art has historically been leveraged as a symbol of status since even before the Renaissance era and has become explicitly more so in recent times with the mass-produced figurines created by pop artists such as Kaws, Takashi Murakami, and Jeff Koons. Certain names at the forefront of Crypto-art such as Hackatao, Beeple, and others who release exclusive drops with Nifty Gateway are received with parallel celebrity status. The price range of these works are often only affordable to wealthy investors, most of whom purchase with the intention of flipping it down the line for massive profit. It is hard to distinguish whether what is being developed is a new manner in engaging with artwork or simply another economy of investment.
        </p>
        <p>
        One way in which the developing system can change to become more accessible is for artists to create variations on their work with different edition sizes. At the moment, the rising price floor on more well-known crypto art is the artificially imposed scarcity. But if artists created different variations on their work with edition sizes ranging from hundreds of thousands to single digits, it gives an opportunity for both wealthy investors and the general populace alike to proudly own and support the artist.

        Aside from the art school student who might be minting their work in order to pay off their student debt, I wanted to find out what kind of artists and creators were actually achieving success in the industry. I’ve been personally invested in the NFT and greater Crypto community since early February and been able to meet and talk to both creators and investors through Discord and Twitter. It’s a peculiar, as there’s a lot of money floating around, and it’s not unusual to be interacting with someone who’s net worth is nine figures. Most accounts are anonymous and become known by their cartoon profile pictures, which become solidified and memed into online identities. The current trend is couches. Large accounts have couchified their original profile picture into what they would look like if they were a cartoon couch. It’s a weird space.
        </p>
        <p>
        One person who’s been extremely successful in the community is Ben Mauro. He’s a senior concept designer who’s done a lot of the character design and world building for large-budget movies and video games, such as the Halo series, Call of Duty, the Hobbit, and Elysium. For the past ten years he’s also been working on a personal project named Evolution, digital illustrations of primate and extraterrestrial characters he’s created. Prior to the rise of the NFT economy, he wasn’t sure how to release his project, as typically these characters need an underlying framework, whether that meant a comic book, trading cards, or movie. With NFT’s, however, Ben was able to release the project as a card series without needing an extensive team. The platform he released Evolution on, Vive, handled the launch and distribution.
        </p>
        <p>
        “It [NFTs] kind of flips things on its head. Before it would take all this time and energy to make something, and maybe you might make some money. But now it’s the opposite. You can make things relatively easy now and earn a bunch of money up front. If down the line I want to turn this into a movie, I have the time and resources and won’t have to go begging to Netflix to have them turn this into a series.”
        </p>
        <p>
        Ben and I agreed on the oversaturation of the NFT collectible’s space. These days there are clones of almost any successful project imaginable. Cryptopunks alone has over fifty spoof variations with varying degrees of success, the most popular being Bastard Gan Punks which are created by running the database of all 10,000 cryptopunks through Nvidia’s StyleGAN 2.0 to create machine learning generated punks.  There is simply not enough money entering the space to keep up with the expansion of content. Since the boost in popularity on Nifty Gateway since late February, the market cap for most projects have dropped over 80 percent. Collectible projects like Ben’s Evolution and NBA Top Shot have experienced similar, although less intense dips. It’s a given that most of these projects won’t last. The question was: How do you make an NFT collectible project that’s built to last?
        </p>
        <p>
        “In order to keep the value in the long term you have to turn it into a product,” Ben says. While that makes sense, there’s a conundrum that creators will have to face. If you release more content, but the incoming capital to the market can’t keep up, it’ll only serve to dilute the entire market which won’t inspire confidence in investors.
        </p>
        <p>
        “It’s always a balance of volume of content, keeping the rarity, and utility. Like, okay maybe there’s a lot of utility, but there’s too much stuff.” We agreed that long-term utility was the name of the game moving forwards. The dopamine rush of purchasing an NFT can only last so long. Collectors want to be able to do things with them. Although it’ll take a lot of work, Ben says he’s planning on building an infrastructure for Evolution, whether that’ll be in the format of a card game, video game, or something entirely new.
        </p>
        <p>
        There are creators like Ben whose personal work ends up being compatible with the format of collectible trading cards. Most digital artists minting NFTs, however, often need to rely on curated platforms such as Super Rare to promote and distribute their work, typically in the form of limited edition or one-of-one drops. I spoke to artist Yebu-Tonu whose fourth NFT artwork was released on Super Rare this week.  It depicts a 3D model of a human molting and spitting out a new copy in a continuous cycle. “In this scene there persists an ambiguity of “procreator” and “procreated”. The figure continuously (re)expunges itself orally, in which one shrivels up and collapses into a small hole, while the other is set back up to do the same task eternally.” Like many other digital artists, Yebu-Tonu works in 3d animation for his day job and creates personal work on the side. All his releases up to date on Super Rare have been one-of-one. I asked him if the NFT marketplace has brought him any additional affordances compared to before his work was minted on the blockchain.
        </p>
        <p>
        Yebu-Tonu says the additional money from his work has been a bonus, but what he really valued were the connections he was able to make with his clients. The NFT space has eliminated most of the transactional middlemen. He’s able to sell directly to clients without being represented by a gallery or agent. For his first piece, He was able to get into contact with a collector who had purchased a colleagues genesis piece, and the client, who goes by the name of the Museum of Crypto Art (MoCA) offered to purchase it. While most of the money in the space tends to be speculative and investment oriented, MoCA is one of the rare collectors who’s in it for the art. You can go to their website and walk through a 3D digital gallery of his collection.  We talked about how the online community for crypto and NFT’s is still ground level enough that it only takes a few hoops to jump through before you’re able to connect with the most invested collectors and creators.
        </p>
        <p>
        Throughout my entire conversation with Kenny, the auction for his piece continues. The timer is extended an additional five minutes each time a new bid is placed. This will continue until after we hang up. It’s a bidding war between two users. One, Alfred Itchblock, has a profile picture of Alfred Hitchcock, and no NFTs in his collection. It’s clearly a burner account that will ultimately plans on transferring the NFT to a separate private wallet. The other, RultonFyder, is a username I recognize. A few weeks ago, he purchased an NFT minted by Azealia Banks of the audio of her sex tape with artist Ryder Ripps. He’s also the proud owner of five out of six of the Brazzer’s ZZ Pops, their exclusive NFT released on the site Rarible. I mention him to Kenny, who reveals that he RultonFyder is most likely an alias. He thinks he’s an art dealer who he knows in real life. On the internet, Rulton claims to be a smalltime farm owner from Montana and an NFT artist. He even has an artnet profile.
        </p>
        <p>
        The question that I reckon with, alongside many others who have invested in the space, is whether NFTs are here to stay. I hope so. Kenny believes so. They’ve been pulled into the existing establishment, given the multiple listings at Christies and Sotheby’s. But like Kenny told me, art is hyper popularizing at an alarming rate. Everything is now corporate sponsored – even Pornhub is investing in exhibitions. Most of the bidders for Beeple’s Christie’s auction were new to the auction house. Who knows if this has all just been a scheme by the world of fine art to draw in new money? For the time being, I’m still working on mining enough Ethereum so I can make an offer on Kenny’s Jeff Koons NFT.
