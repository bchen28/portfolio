It was his wedding anniversary that weekend, and I had spent the entire morning running a daisy chain of errands from forge to studio to Whole Foods and back again. One metal sculptor had made me ride on his invention (patented), a scooter-skateboard hybrid equipped with a 100cc combustion engine.<br/>\n          &emsp;&emsp; I was working for a fashion photographer in Los Angeles who had risen to prominence in the early 2000s. In the mornings I would either be in his retouching studio mounting prints for Harper’s Bazaar and Gucci, or in the backseat of an Uber running errands between Hollywood and Santa Monica. Some afternoons, after eating lunch at the Whole Foods next to Venice Beach, I’d head to the large shed in my boss’s backyard where I archived old negatives of weddings and Prada campaigns. On the weekends, I would spend  my meager intern’s salary at different museums, seeking enlightenment from prints of the photographs they teach in art school. I remember my first week in the city, taking the bus downtown to the Museum of Contemporary Art to view Diane Arbus’s <i>identical twins, Roselle, New Jersey, 1967</i>. In the gift shop, I purchased <i>The Photographer’s Playbook</i>, a compendium of stories, tips, and exercises from over a hundred industry photographers. Since there existed great photographs, there existed attributes that made a photograph great. And while I didn’t necessarily want industry success, it was easy to tie it to greatness, and that was what I wanted more than anything—the ability to discern what made a photograph ‘great’.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          I don’t know what first attracted me to shooting film. Perhaps it was the Larry Clark x Supreme collab or the same reason alt-teens arrive at college with a Fjallraven backpack. I quickly became more interested in combing through the rare scraps of PDF photo books available online than taking photos. Like an athlete practicing for a match, I became obsessed with training my eye before tackling the camera. By the time I arrived in LA, I had taken no more than five rolls. I felt that my photos carried no intent, made no effort to reckon with the world as I saw it. Any pleasure I gained from my camera was dampened by the similarity I found between my work and that which dominated photography contests for amateurs. I enjoyed capturing products of industrialism fallen into decrepitude, such as office chairs with scuffed upholstery and broken-down trucks. Something about the materiality of analog film lends itself to reflective nostalgia. Once there is a base cost of producing a photograph— film, scanning, development, printing—there is suddenly a stake to releasing the shutter. The photographer falls prey to the misconception that each photograph must be extraordinary, which is at odds with how banal we perceive our surroundings, and the instinct is to run away from the familiar and towards the unknown. <br/>\n          &emsp;&emsp;That summer, the Getty opened a new exhibit, <i>Icons of Style: A Century of Fashion Photography</i>, housed next to a rotating selection of famous prints from their archives. Included was a photograph taken by my boss of Kate Moss standing in Times Square, her fist blurred in front of the lens. He would tell me stories about living with Mario Sorrenti in his twenties, going to the darkroom in the city, and making color proofs next to Robert Frank. A print from <i>the Americans</i> hung on his wall, adorned in the kind of simple frame friends gift one another. I hungered for these stories of past interactions, believing that within them I could glean some thread of achievement or a lesson to be learned. I chose to spend a lot of afternoons in my boss’s shed, unpacking boxes of expensive photo books sheathed in plastic dust covers. They helped me develop a sense of what I would come to consider the American gold standard in portraiture—Walker Evans, Richard Avedon, Diane Arbus. In their portraits, there seemed to be an unspoken dialogue between the subject and the spectator, a compromised understanding behind the scene. When his subjects stood in front of the stark white backdrop of his studio, Avedon would not look through the ground glass of his Deardorff large format camera, but instead converse with and instruct them, pressing the shutter release cable when he thought their image was ready to be revealed to the world. In his book, In the American West, each photo stares back at me with variations of the same unyielding gaze. <br/>\n          &emsp;&emsp;In the <i>Photographer’s Playbook</i>, an entry by Shelby Lee Adams suggests asking your subject to find their reflection within the lens. <i>In that singular moment, people are less focused on projecting an image of themselves for the camera and are more looking to find themselves</i>. There are several entries like his, exercises to coax your subject to drop their guard in order to capture the moment they are most at ease. Avedon’s subjects do not look comfortable or at ease. Instead, I would describe them as present. Sitting at the bar of an oyster shack (rare, as he was often away in Milan that summer), my boss told me, <i>it isn’t enough to lead someone to the perfect photograph, you have to teach them to make that choice themselves</i>. Photographers are preoccupied with the idea of a ‘candid’ photograph. It is an impossible task when taking a portrait. If you choose to ignore the camera’s presence, it will balloon until it fills the room.  I wonder how long it took Avedon to manufacture his conversational trick labyrinth, to have each subject ready to defy the passage of time with a look that said, here, look at me as I am now.<br/>\n          &emsp;&emsp;On the weekends, I would take the bus around Los Angeles, riding not under the pretense of transportation, but for the intervals when the city’s ranks would gather around the glass booths. I told myself at each bus stop I would interact with one person, take one portrait, but it felt like I had fallen into the role of an unwilling anthropologist. Each moment felt contrived, each photograph stripped of authenticity. Every time I looked past my viewfinder I was gripped by guilt, afraid I was becoming a class voyeur. I was persistently unsuccessful, and by the end of the summer, I had accumulated leaflets of contact sheets filled with empty bus stops, the recently departed.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          I first viewed Woodman’s photographs with the understanding that her work has influenced a generation of fashion photographers, and that she took her own life at age 22. Her work has been published extensively in several collections and anthologies, and select prints will sell upwards of $100,000. Her death has been described as ‘untimely’ (most young people’s suicides are) and her photos ‘haunting’. The following year, I had the privilege of viewing the Rhode Island School of Design’s archive of Woodman’s past correspondences. There, I found a reliquary, home for her letters to Wendy MacNeil (her professor at the time), postcard-sized prints taped to A4 paper with masking tape. Some had been written during her time abroad in Italy, others following her graduation from RISD. The Manila envelopes she had used to send her work were discolored and had faded into a shade of muddy lavender and mustard. Each envelope had the same picture taped to its center, a portrait of Woodman. Her raven hair is tied in a bun. She is wearing a high collar lace dress. In a flowing ballpoint script, the words <i>please send pictures back to Francesca Woodman 33 2nd Ave. NY </i>floated above her. The material was collected post-mortem—she had no reason to believe they would be seen outside of their initial confidentiality.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          What is a photograph? I felt like I had missed the point. In technical terms, it is the result of a long lineage of techniques, originating with Niepce’s heliograph nearly two centuries ago (though Daguerre is given most of the credit). Modern-day film negatives are coated in silver halide emulsions that, when washed away, leave only the chemical imprint engraved by waves of light. Once the negative has been scanned and inverted, or a positive print has been made, the resulting photograph can be viewed from infinite angles. A modern-day image processing algorithm would analyze each pixel (in grid-like batches) to detect edges and features, running probability distributions that determine the likelihood of a matching object or face existing in the shot. Unlike a computer, the human experience of looking at a photograph goes beyond our visual experience—we don’t simply acknowledge what exists within the frame, but rather make cognitive connections between what we see in the photograph and our memories, daily experiences, what we see in the news and other media.<br/>\n          &emsp;&emsp;In his essay \"Appearances\", John Berger writes how in photography, unlike any other creative medium, <i>the photographer only makes, in any one photograph, a single constitutive choice: the choice of the instant to be photographed</i>. And while this might undermine the infinitude of other choices made in tandem (the lighting, the composition, etc.), the only synaptic response directly attributing to the resultant photograph is the firing of the motor neurons, those responsible for movement of the index finger to release to the shutter. Because the photograph is an imprint in time, it carries inherent ambiguity and will deceive whether or not it intends to (as each viewing is based on a cognitive framework unique to the spectator). The photograph is a discontinuity taken from the continuum, blind to the events that precede and supersede its creation—it is what the spectator makes it to be, which is why the photograph lends itself so quickly to projection.<br/>\n          &emsp;&emsp;In a review by <i>The Guardian</i>, Sean O’Hagan describes Woodman as <i>Alice about to disappear through the looking glass.</i> I have always been uncomfortable with how quick the media and critics are to venerate Woodman with the pre-Raphaelite adoration reserved for white-laced martyrs and saints. It reminds me too much of Ophelia and the Lisbon girls, of Sylvia Plath, how Woodman’s photographs have served as vessels to inhabit the standing culture’s obsession with young female suicides. Looking at her work, I am not ‘haunted’ by the reverie left behind of her blurred body, the long exposures of her obfuscation by chipped plaster and water tanks. All I am reminded of are the endless hours I’ve spent alone in the RISD darkrooms, confined in a solitary cubicle under dim, red light and the isolation of the printing process, a senseless suspension interrupted only by the timed bright light of the enlarger. The RISD Museum houses a print of hers, <i>Untitled (greenhouse)</i>, which depicts her crouched beneath the speckled shadows cast by the canopy of plants and the greenhouse ceiling. Her eyes are closed, and her hand is blurred in motion. When I first came upon it, I thought of a photo of mine taken in that same corridor of that same greenhouse, a portrait of a friend. They are not that different, albeit my friend looks more poised and far less comfortable in front of the mechanical gaze of the lens. Both photos carried a 4x5 aspect ratio, and I wondered whether Woodman captured herself with the same clunky monorail, struggling to adjust the stiff bellows.<br/>\n          &emsp;&emsp;In her letters to Wendy MacNeil, Woodman’s cramped chicken-scratch hugs her postcard prints. She curved her letters, sometimes drawing strict lines through passages filled with wit and nonchalance, but also with the fearful anticipation that accompanies success and failure. Sometimes she mocked herself, other times the world around her. A shadow of doubt seemed to follow her. She lived in an era where written communication was not cheap like it is today. It was her words and not her image that gave her shape outside the frame.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          I wanted to formulate a methodology concerning how I viewed the photograph beyond what existed within the visual frame. It was clear that Woodman’s photographs were lacking to me in the absence of her correspondence between her and MacNeil. They were too easily exploited without written context, the act of viewing them too assuming and dubious on the part of the spectator. I became obsessed with not the images themselves, but rather the manners in which they could be seen to escape the physical confines of technicality. There had to be something in capturing an image that lay beyond the machinations of the camera, the stoichiometry of developing and printing. It seemed impertinent for the photograph to be viewed as the final product when it was a mere fragment of a continuum, especially when its legacy failed to carry the original intent under which it was created. The obvious solution was to photograph the entire continuum, or in the other words, turn towards film as a medium. However, videos structured themselves too easily around narrative, promoting a narrow range of consumption. Unable to be read, the intent of the photographer is often absent in the space of the narrative. As the viewer, you can pick up visual cues and historical context, but the uncertainty can never be erased.<br/>\n          &emsp;&emsp;There is a photograph described by Barthes in Camera Lucida, known as the Winter Garden photograph, that he uses to inspect the personal interest a spectator holds in any given photograph. This photograph, of his mother as a child, is absent among the appendix of photographs Barthes chose to include in his work. Its significance was exclusive to an individual (Barthes). Can a photograph exist in the absence of the image? The photograph is a recreation of an image. If an image is a perceived moment in time (the visual scene that the photographer witnesses), then the photograph is the medium that allows the image to travel beyond the moment. We, the spectators, were not present when the image was captured through the lens of the camera. Instead, we are subjected to viewing the image in discontinuity, taken from its present and placed within ours. The image we are now viewing (defined as the photograph) is one that was imagined by the image-taker, the photographer. While we never get to see the original Winter Garden image or it’s translation, (transferring a photograph to print is an act of translation, albeit one with little information lost or changed), we are shown a new ‘photograph’ altogether. In the process of creating discourse surrounding the Winter Garden photograph, Barthes has described, and therefore depicted, an entirely new and reimagined photograph for the reader (spectator) that can exist in isolation from the original. I view Woodman’s correspondance with MacNeil in the same manner. It is a photograph stitched together from written moments separated temporally by years, and geographically by an ocean’s length. In it, I feel as if I can see Woodman more clearly than in any other photograph she has taken of herself.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          I spent over a year doing various exercises from The Photographer’s Playbook, several entries telling me to shoot more, think less, several more telling me to think more, shoot less. Other notable entries directed me to look at Diane Arbus, Francesca Woodman, to discard Berger for Fanon and read Barthes and interestingly, Borges and Emily Dickinson. That they would direct me to Borges, a master in crafting stories built upon words was perhaps indicative of everything I was unable to find within the photograph. The lesson that has stuck with me the longest was a lesson from Kota Ezawa: to make a photograph, and then when you are done, don’t take a picture of it. It would be my last lesson from the playbook and the last roll I have developed since then. A contact print filled with my grimacing face. It was nice, each time encountering a photograph I thought worth capturing, to let it escape. To turn the camera on myself and have the world observe me, observing it.\n        </p>\n        <img className = \"text-image\" src ={FrancescaWoodman}/>\n\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\nimport \"../styles/global.css\";\n\nexport default class NFTEssay extends Component {\n  render(){\n    return(\n      <div>\n        <p>\n          {'<DOES ANYONE STILL CARE ABOUT NFTS>'} <br/>\n          <i>By Bowen Chen</i> <br/>\n        </p>\n        <p><i>Note: this article was originally written in April 2021. At the time the price of ETH was still $1100 and the term \"NFT\" was still a conversational novelty.</i></p>\n\n        <p>\n        As soon as Kenny Schachter appears on screen for our scheduled call, I knew I was going to enjoy our conversation. It feels funny admitting him from my zoom ‘waiting room’ into my ‘personal meeting room,’ as I sit in the undigested mess of my Providence college apartment and he in his what I imagine to be very posh and expensive Manhattan home, filled with Mary Heilmann chairs and Peter Hujar prints.  He is one of those people I meet and have a gut instinct will be easy to talk to. Within a minute into our call, I’m alone again in my zoom room. He’s left to check on the auction for his collaborative piece with Jerry Saltz, listed on the digital art marketplace Super Rare that’s about to end. It’s a collage tapestry of Jerry’s Instagram posts from March 2012 to April 21st, minted on the blockchain as a non-fungible token (NFT), called the First 10,000.  It’s a reference to Beeple’s <i>the First 5,000 Days </i> which sold for $69.3 million on Christie’s a little over a month ago.  The piece reminds me of a crossover between Richard Prince’s Instagram canvases (although far less narcissistic) and one of those photo tapestry’s where you walk out, and it reveals a larger constructed image of George Bush. Ten thousand Instagram posts is a lot – that’s roughly three posts per day for the past nine years. The timing is so impeccable that I wouldn’t hesitate to believe if it was premeditated in some master plan hatched by Jerry and Kenny.\n\n        </p>\n\n        Kenny Schacter is many things. Amongst others he’s an artist, a writer, a curator, and a collector. When he writes, he’s professionally unhinged in the way that only people who’ve made it can afford. In a recent NFT article he wrote for Artnet, he calls David Gerard ‘the NFT antichrist’ in response to Gerard’s latest book, the Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain.  Like me, he’s an NFT maximalist and has been very vocally adamant that they are here to stay.\n\n        <p>\n\n        For those who are completely oblivious to what I’m talking about, you might be living under a rock. In the past two months NFTs have received an extraordinary amount of media coverage, from articles in the New York Times and the New Yorker, to even an SNL skit called “What the Hell’s an NFT?” that SNL made into an NFT days later and sold for 172 Eth (currently $430 thousand).  It’s easiest to think of them as digital objects that comes with a deed of ownership. They’re minted on the blockchain and can be kept and transferred between digital wallets. Like any physical asset you own, a car or your house, you can auction NFTs on marketplaces or sell them directly to others.\n\n        </p>\n        <p>\n\n        It is hard to grasp the concept of a non-fungible token. Non-fungible means that the objects aren’t interchangeable, you can’t easily redeem an NFT on a crypto exchange for another asset like you can Bitcoin or Ethereum (which are fungible tokens). NFTs can be anything, really, the most common forms ranging from digital art to videos to trading card collectibles. Some NFTs are so indiscriminate that you can’t help but wonder who would even want to own them. You can now bid on a limited edition photography collection of former Seattle Seahawk’s running back Marshawn Lynch’s collaboration with Dodi blunts or Brazzer’s one-of-one collectible lollipops featuring your favorite porn star.   Some NFT collectibles with the largest market caps are Cryptopunks, 24x24 pixel cartoon portraits inspired by the London punk scene, the cheapest selling for $50 thousand.  Christie’s recently listed nine of them for auction. Others include NBA Top Shot (partnered with the NBA) , which releases collectible NBA moments and Zed Run, a platform where users can breed, race, and bet on digital TRON-esque horses.  There’s a complex system built in of generational breeding, genotype purity, and bloodline scarcity. Most importantly, people are pumping these projects with money – massive amounts of money. The most expensive sales respectively to date have been a moment of Lebron James selling for $280,000 and a Nakamoto-breed horse sold for $125,000. Aside from collectibles, the other booming NFT market has been digital artwork. In late February a piece by the digital artist Beeple sold on the site Nifty Gateway for $6.6 million, breaking the record for the most expensive digital artwork ever sold. The 10-secnond clip portrayed a digitally rendered Donald Trump covered in slogans, collapsed on a grassy lawn as pedestrians walked by. Nearly two months later, he broke his prior record over ten-fold with his Christie’s listing.\n\n        </p>\n        <p>\n\n        Owning an NFT doesn’t give you commercial rights – most aren’t even exclusive content that can’t be found elsewhere on the internet. To many, the idea is confounding. You might ask: why would one pay thousands of dollars for an image or a video clip that can be viewed at any time on Instagram or YouTube? But then again, the same can be said about traditional artwork. Why pay tens of thousands for a Stephen Shore print or a Picasso when you can just as easily print them on canvas or photographic printing paper for less than twenty bucks?\n\n        </p>\n        <p>\n\n        Kenny’s an artist who entered the scene on the earlier, releasing his first NFT collection with Nifty Gateway back in November. Nifty Gateway along with Super Rare and MakersPlace are marketplaces that team up with artists to curate limited edition releases.  Back then, Nifty released a collection once a week. Now, there seems to be fifteen different drops each day, with a long line of artists trying to score a collaboration. Kenny was placed on a several month waitlist for his next drop. He’s minted a lot of NFT’s and you can view most of them on his profile on OpenSeas.  One features a Jeff Koons balloon dog sculpture standing on a hill overlooking a favela. Another features a short screen recording from his iPhone of him deleting the audio-chat app Clubhouse. During our conversation I called him a normie for using Clubhouse and he told me he made that NFT after a stranger in a chatroom called him a racist. We talked about the hypocrisy of the masses and the public outcry at the energy consumption required to mint an NFT.\n\n        </p>\n        <p>\n\n        “No one’s talked about the energy usage of oil paint or stretchers for canvases or single-use shipping containers or a gigantic Kaws sculpture made of say endangered trees.”\n\n        </p>\n        <p>\n\n        I explained to him the concept of an Instagram infographic and how the online herd mentality contributes to the dissemination of unreliable information. Sometime last year there was public outcry surrounding a post cancelling Google and Apple for taking Palestine off their map services.  The State of Palestine has never been on either Google or Apple maps.\n\n        </p>\n        <p>\n\n        “I went to Ghana to write a feature for GQ magazine and immediately thought everything I did in my life was senseless and immoral. You have this stupid recreation of this children’s entertainment thing – dog – and to put that in context of pervasive property takes on an altogether different meaning. So that piece reflecting a favela means a lot different than reflecting a collector in an auction house or their front garden in Greenwich Connecticut.”\n\n        </p>\n        <p>\n\n        Some of my other favorites minted by Kenny include an image of a green grape with a face drawn on in sharpie titled “what’s eating gilbert grape.” Another is an edited video of a user visiting Pornhub and searching “Special: Pornhub goes Fine Art! We teamed up with a LA Art Gallery and Commissioned Feminist Art Porn. It can’t get better than that! Here’s ‘The Pleasure Principle.”’ What follows is a poorly photoshopped montage of people I assume to be in the art world over porn actors mixed to ‘Where are you baby?’ by Betty Boo. Michele Maccarone receives the greatest amount of screen time.\n\n        </p>\n        <p>\n\n        This turned out to be a real event. In 2019, Pornhub commissioned an exhibit at LA’s Maccarone gallery called ‘The Pleasure Principle’ featuring an expansive list of female artists including names such as Louise Bourgeois. Pornhub described the exhibition as “dismantling the art/porn binary, positing arousal as a universal goal, transcending boundaries that separate the sexual from the aesthetic, the surreal from the sensible, the occult from the mainstream.”  Kenny’s video ends in an image of Maccarone with a speech bubble that reads in all caps, “Get F*cked twice!! Watch the videos then buy one of these paintings! 15% discount for pornhubbers!”\n\n        </p>\n        <p>\n\n        I ask Kenny if he thinks NFTs will be around to stay, or if people are just hopping on the trend to make a quick buck.\n\n        </p>\n        <p>\n\n        “I think even Jerry got sucked into the idea of unlimited wealth, it’s something irresistible to even the purest – I mean I’m surprised some priest or reverend or nun hasn’t started - Mother Theresa would’ve been minting NFT’s if she was alive,” Kenny says, then as if to make a note to himself he mutters, “I should make a fucking Mother Theresa NFT.”\n\n        </p>\n        <p>\n\n        Kenny and Jerry aren’t making any money off their auction. Originally, they had planned to keep 10% of the profit and donate 90% but now 100% is of proceeds are being donated to Memorial Sloan Kettering and the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. Kenny keeps complaining about how Jerry’s the one who roped him into all this, and now he isn’t even getting paid a pretty penny, but I can tell he doesn’t really mind.\n        </p>\n\n        <p style ={{textAlign:\"center\"}}> +++ </p>\n\n        <p>\n        I spoke to Danny Adkins, a co-founder behind the website MomentRanks, one of the leading websites that help collectors of NBA Top Shot appraise their collection and track its market value. Adkins has been closely following crypto and blockchain since he was in eighth grade, when people still used thousands of bitcoins to pay for their pizza. As we call, the rest of his team is working around the clock to roll out their new features in time for the NBA All Star game next weekend.\n\n        </p>\n        <p>\n\n        “I view this as the first mainstream push for decentralization of the internet. People are finally socializing through alternative channels in doing trade and content creation. It’s a rebellion against the centralized control of the internet that taken shape over the last fifteen years.” We talk a bit about the NBA and trading cards before I bring up the topic of tokenization of digital artwork and its monetization, whether it’s a bubble that’s bound to burst.\n\n        </p>\n        <p>\n\n        “I’ve been around the block long enough to know that things are definitely hyped and over-inflated at the moment. The market’s due for a correction, but I think there is the added aspect of mass accessibility. It’s paving the way for future applications that will actually be useful.”\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        He tells me the “gimmick,” so-to-speak, of NFT’s is that with blockchain there is a built-in license of ownership and a public ledger of all transactions. It attempts to tackle one of the image’s inherent qualities in the digital era: infinite distribution and authority of likeness. Currently on the web, if an image you post is replicated and redistributed, after several iterations it becomes extremely difficult for other users to trace back to the original content. There’s no cost for another user to take your image and share it under their domain. Using Google’s reverse image search, Dorothea Lange’s “Migrant Mother” photograph pings over six hundred separate websites. In the case of NFT’s, each is an object that has an associated cost to be placed on the blockchain (the computational cost of minting), that provide a public proof of ownership. It’s important to note that this doesn’t stop the metadata (whatever digital content is attached to the NFT) from circulating the internet, but instead provides a mechanism to clearly distinguish copies from an original along with a codified trail that leads back to it.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        The conundrum for many is that the monetary value of tokenized images seems to arise from thin air. This fails to take into account, that engagement creates revenue. Most centralized internet platforms we use to view these images and other media have commodified content to have users believe that views and likes are rewards in it of themselves. Every time content is retweeted, redistributed, reformatted, it leads to increased user engagement which results in profits for the parent company, none of which trickle back to the original creator. NFTs are beginning to provide original content creators with the opportunity to monetize their past creations. This has become extremely prevalent regarding landmarks and milestones in the history of social media. In the past two weeks, examples of this have been the creator of Nyan Cat tokenizing the gif and selling it for over $600,000, the original trollface selling for $7,000, the pixel deal-with-it sunglass gif selling for $27,000. The most iconic (and expensive) example of this is perhaps Jack Dorsey, the founder Twitter, tokenizing his first tweet which reads “just setting up my twittr” and auctioning it. The current highest bid is $2.5 million.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        Adkins agrees with me that the meteoric rise we’ve seen in collecting NFTs can be partly attributed to the pandemic, how it has deprived us of the familiar capitalist pleasures of purchasing and being seen with our recent acquisitions – a new outfit, a new coffee table, the new painting on the wall. While we quarantine, the possessions we would normally flaunt in person at dinner parties have been relegated to internet showcases and our Animal Crossing Islands. Having a thriving market where creators could directly engage with other creators and collectors seems to carve out a new space on the internet to socialize and engage with one another through content and trade.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        On the surface, it seems like sites such as Super Rare are providing artists and creators an alternative marketplace where they can sell their work directly to collectors, circumventing the current institutional dredges of dealers, agents, and galleries. The delegation of power returning to the individuals who are generating the form of capital can even be read from a Marxist standpoint. Once an NFT artwork leaves the hands of the creator, ten percent of each resale in the future trickles back to the artist. However, upon a closer analysis, there is an unnerving quality to the mimesis of NFT artwork in relation to the existing system.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        While I find it amazing that certain digital artists are finally being recognized and are receiving handsome sums for their work, it seems rather than become more accessible, the marketplace for NFT artwork is instead morphing into a digital clone of the existing, tactile, pop art market. Fine art has historically been leveraged as a symbol of status since even before the Renaissance era and has become explicitly more so in recent times with the mass-produced figurines created by pop artists such as Kaws, Takashi Murakami, and Jeff Koons. Certain names at the forefront of Crypto-art such as Hackatao, Beeple, and others who release exclusive drops with Nifty Gateway are received with parallel celebrity status. The price range of these works are often only affordable to wealthy investors, most of whom purchase with the intention of flipping it down the line for massive profit. It is hard to distinguish whether what is being developed is a new manner in engaging with artwork or simply another economy of investment.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        One way in which the developing system can change to become more accessible is for artists to create variations on their work with different edition sizes. At the moment, the rising price floor on more well-known crypto art is the artificially imposed scarcity. But if artists created different variations on their work with edition sizes ranging from hundreds of thousands to single digits, it gives an opportunity for both wealthy investors and the general populace alike to proudly own and support the artist.\n        </p>\n\n        <p style ={{textAlign:\"center\"}}> +++ </p>\n\n        <p>\n        Aside from the art school student who might be minting their work in order to pay off their student debt, I wanted to find out what kind of artists and creators were actually achieving success in the industry. I’ve been personally invested in the NFT and greater Crypto community since early February and been able to meet and talk to both creators and investors through Discord and Twitter. It’s a peculiar, as there’s a lot of money floating around, and it’s not unusual to be interacting with someone who’s net worth is nine figures. Most accounts are anonymous and become known by their cartoon profile pictures, which become solidified and memed into online identities. The current trend is couches. Large accounts have couchified their original profile picture into what they would look like if they were a cartoon couch. It’s a weird space.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        One person who’s been extremely successful in the community is Ben Mauro. He’s a senior concept designer who’s done a lot of the character design and world building for large-budget movies and video games, such as the Halo series, Call of Duty, the Hobbit, and Elysium. For the past ten years he’s also been working on a personal project named Evolution, digital illustrations of primate and extraterrestrial characters he’s created. Prior to the rise of the NFT economy, he wasn’t sure how to release his project, as typically these characters need an underlying framework, whether that meant a comic book, trading cards, or movie. With NFT’s, however, Ben was able to release the project as a card series without needing an extensive team. The platform he released Evolution on, Vive, handled the launch and distribution.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        “It [NFTs] kind of flips things on its head. Before it would take all this time and energy to make something, and maybe you might make some money. But now it’s the opposite. You can make things relatively easy now and earn a bunch of money up front. If down the line I want to turn this into a movie, I have the time and resources and won’t have to go begging to Netflix to have them turn this into a series.”\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        Ben and I agreed on the oversaturation of the NFT collectible’s space. These days there are clones of almost any successful project imaginable. Cryptopunks alone has over fifty spoof variations with varying degrees of success, the most popular being Bastard Gan Punks which are created by running the database of all 10,000 cryptopunks through Nvidia’s StyleGAN 2.0 to create machine learning generated punks.  There is simply not enough money entering the space to keep up with the expansion of content. Since the boost in popularity on Nifty Gateway since late February, the market cap for most projects have dropped over 80 percent. Collectible projects like Ben’s Evolution and NBA Top Shot have experienced similar, although less intense dips. It’s a given that most of these projects won’t last. The question was: How do you make an NFT collectible project that’s built to last?\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        “In order to keep the value in the long term you have to turn it into a product,” Ben says. While that makes sense, there’s a conundrum that creators will have to face. If you release more content, but the incoming capital to the market can’t keep up, it’ll only serve to dilute the entire market which won’t inspire confidence in investors.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        “It’s always a balance of volume of content, keeping the rarity, and utility. Like, okay maybe there’s a lot of utility, but there’s too much stuff.” We agreed that long-term utility was the name of the game moving forwards. The dopamine rush of purchasing an NFT can only last so long. Collectors want to be able to do things with them. Although it’ll take a lot of work, Ben says he’s planning on building an infrastructure for Evolution, whether that’ll be in the format of a card game, video game, or something entirely new.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        There are creators like Ben whose personal work ends up being compatible with the format of collectible trading cards. Most digital artists minting NFTs, however, often need to rely on curated platforms such as Super Rare to promote and distribute their work, typically in the form of limited edition or one-of-one drops. I spoke to artist Yebu-Tonu whose fourth NFT artwork was released on Super Rare this week.  It depicts a 3D model of a human molting and spitting out a new copy in a continuous cycle. “In this scene there persists an ambiguity of “procreator” and “procreated”. The figure continuously (re)expunges itself orally, in which one shrivels up and collapses into a small hole, while the other is set back up to do the same task eternally.” Like many other digital artists, Yebu-Tonu works in 3d animation for his day job and creates personal work on the side. All his releases up to date on Super Rare have been one-of-one. I asked him if the NFT marketplace has brought him any additional affordances compared to before his work was minted on the blockchain.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        Yebu-Tonu says the additional money from his work has been a bonus, but what he really valued were the connections he was able to make with his clients. The NFT space has eliminated most of the transactional middlemen. He’s able to sell directly to clients without being represented by a gallery or agent. For his first piece, He was able to get into contact with a collector who had purchased a colleagues genesis piece, and the client, who goes by the name of the Museum of Crypto Art (MoCA) offered to purchase it. While most of the money in the space tends to be speculative and investment oriented, MoCA is one of the rare collectors who’s in it for the art. You can go to their website and walk through a 3D digital gallery of his collection.  We talked about how the online community for crypto and NFT’s is still ground level enough that it only takes a few hoops to jump through before you’re able to connect with the most invested collectors and creators.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        Throughout my entire conversation with Kenny, the auction for his piece continues. The timer is extended an additional five minutes each time a new bid is placed. This will continue until after we hang up. It’s a bidding war between two users. One, Alfred Itchblock, has a profile picture of Alfred Hitchcock, and no NFTs in his collection. It’s clearly a burner account that will ultimately plans on transferring the NFT to a separate private wallet. The other, RultonFyder, is a username I recognize. A few weeks ago, he purchased an NFT minted by Azealia Banks of the audio of her sex tape with artist Ryder Ripps. He’s also the proud owner of five out of six of the Brazzer’s ZZ Pops, their exclusive NFT released on the site Rarible. I mention him to Kenny, who reveals that he RultonFyder is most likely an alias. He thinks he’s an art dealer who he knows in real life. On the internet, Rulton claims to be a smalltime farm owner from Montana and an NFT artist. He even has an artnet profile.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        The question that I reckon with, alongside many others who have invested in the space, is whether NFTs are here to stay. I hope so. Kenny believes so. They’ve been pulled into the existing establishment, given the multiple listings at Christies and Sotheby’s. But like Kenny told me, art is hyper popularizing at an alarming rate. Everything is now corporate sponsored – even Pornhub is investing in exhibitions. Most of the bidders for Beeple’s Christie’s auction were new to the auction house. Who knows if this has all just been a scheme by the world of fine art to draw in new money? For the time being, I’m still working on mining enough Ethereum so I can make an offer on Kenny’s Jeff Koons NFT.\n        </p>\n\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\nimport \"../styles/global.css\";\n\nexport default class AAEssay extends Component {\n  render(){\n    return(\n      <div>\n        <p>\n          A Thin Line: Asian-American Success in Creative Industries <br/>\n          <i>By Bowen Chen</i>\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n        What many people may not remember is that aboard the space shuttle Challenger on that fateful morning was Astronaut Ellison Onizuka, the first Asian American to reach space. For most Americans, the crew of the Challenger were American heroes. For my parents, however, Ellison wasn’t an aerospace pioneer, simply a warning to the dangers of chasing your dreams as another expendable Asian American in a white world.\n        <br/>&emsp;&emsp;\n        At some point in elementary school, around second or third grade I can’t precisely recall, my teacher asked us what we wanted to be when we grew up. When you’re seven years old, you aren't able to name that many careers, only what you see on television or read in picture books. A lot of kids answered with policeman, firefighter, teacher, astronaut. I don’t remember what I said. Back then, I didn’t know what I wanted to be, I only knew what I didn’t want to be – a doctor. At the age of seven, I was already being trained by my parents in the complex field of risk assessment, and more specifically, risk aversion.\n        <br/>&emsp;&emsp;\n\n        For many Chinese-Americans who have grown up in the states, raised by  first-generation immigrant parents, our lives have always centered around the promise of stability. For them their escape from uncertainty meant a proceeding generation paired with the guaranteed likelihood of success, which in their eyes were a series of rings to hop through, items on a bucket list that you checked off one at a time: perfect A’s, ace your SAT, ivy league university, MCATs, residency. To them, becoming a doctor was the ideal job, you spent years of your life climbing rings on a ladder, and then you reap your rewards of guaranteed employment with a six-figure salary. The steps were laid out to you, clear as day. It was all so simple. When I told my dad I was going to study the ever-so-risky profession of Computer Science, he had exclaimed, “Oh that’s not a good job, not a good job at all. The job market is too unstable for computer scientists, you can’t do that for life.” He was referring towards the dot.com crash that had sent many of his colleagues studying the field, to America in search of employment.\n        <br/>&emsp;&emsp;\n\n        In the professional world however, success is not so cut in stone like the path to becoming a doctor. Asian-American’s often find it difficult to rise in the ranks of the corporate world, unable to reach comfortable positions of smiling, handshaking, closing multi-million-dollar deals in glass pent-houses. Despite being trained for success, we have often fallen short. In 2005, Jenny Heung coined the term ‘the bamboo ceiling’ referring to this specific phenomenon. In his 2008 essay, “Paper Tigers”, Wesley Yang talks about this in depth, the external pressure to assimilate in order to succeed the predominately white corporate world. This pressure is similarly offset by the heightened awareness of our identity and the pressure to create work surrounding it in the humanities and creative arts. In its overtly zealous manner in which is ‘encourages’ inclusivity, many ethnic writers have become commercialized, commodified, fetishized, without even realizing it. It is important to remember, that like the corporate world, the art world is also predominantly white and controlled by similar players, yet cognizant of its racial disparities, so it lauds ethnic writers in attempt at self-gratification.\n        <br/>&emsp;&emsp;\n\n        In this day and age, often it is no longer about what we write as authors, but the face behind the writing. Author’s must make sure to carefully align their marginalized characters with their own marginalized identities, or risk being caught in the midst of a Twitterstorm of cancel culture. I am not arguing that this is a bad thing, on the contrary I believe that, when moved away from its extremities, a readership that upholds ethical writing helps draw attention to underrepresented writers whose work more closely draws upon intimate lived experiences. The problem arises, however, when writers use their faces, their skin, as a ‘free pass’ token to create work that is leagues beyond the spectrum of their lived experiences. If I, a second-generation Asian-American were to write an imitation piece trying to be distinctly Chinese, would the online media mob stand to correct me, or quickly pass over my name and the shape of my face and treat them as an undeniable birthright?\n\n        </p>\n        <p style ={{textAlign:\"center\"}}> +++ </p>\n        <p>\n        In 2014, Rupi Kaur published her debut book, a collection of flash poems titled milk and honey. It stayed on the New York Times Bestseller list for over a year and to date, has sold over 2.5 million print copies. Kaur, the most prominent presence behind a rising wave of instapoets, is perhaps also one of the most visible female South-Asian voices in the digital world of contemporary media. Kaur, whose poetry revolves around personal experiences of trauma, femme-narratives, and the South Asian female body, champions transparency for female experiences, especially those regarding trauma. In 2013, she garnered mass media attention when she criticized Instagram for twice deleting a post of her lying in bed with her pants and sheets covered in period blood. The photo was part of a project of Kaur’s that aimed to demystify the taboos surrounding menstruation. In the FAQ section of her website, Kaur responds that her project milk and honey takes from “a lot of pain I’ve experienced or my family has experienced. Or my community has experienced. Or the South Asian community and diaspora”.\n        <br/>&emsp;&emsp;\n\n        In her interview with Playground + , when asked “Why is it so important to tell stories from your culture as a South Asian women”, Kaur says “I can only speak about my lived experience and of the women around me – my mother, the life she’s lived , her mother, my sisters and so on.” In her mission to represent the entirety of South Asian women, Kaur has fallen prey to the ‘uneasy postmodern trend towards collapsing diasporic differences in the postcolonial literature they produce’ as noted by Chiara Giovanni in her Buzzfeed article, originally from Vijay Mishra’s book The Literature of the Indian Diaspora: Theorizing the Diasporic Imaginary. Kaur fails to acknowledge the intricacies behind the diversity behind the lived experiences of South Asians, and even falls short of separating her own identity as a privileged, western-educated Punjabi-Sikh Canadian woman from the South Asian women she claims to champion, whose lived experience differs from hers like night and day.\n        <br/>&emsp;&emsp;\n\n        It is easy to see how Kaur’s poetry is voraciously consumed by white femme millennials across the (western) world. Aside from the simplicity of her poetry, which Kaur openly admits to as stylistic choice, it is gratifying for white readers to feel like their consumption of Kaur’s poetry is serving to broaden their cultural knowledge or help them become more ‘ethnically woke’. In her interview with CBS news, Kaur claims that when her debut book was published, all she wanted was her last name, common among Sikh women, on the cover. In congruence with how Kaur advocates herself as a writer representative of Punjabi-Sikh women, it is easy to see how white audiences retreat to the proximity of her poetry rather than educate themselves with the wide range of South Asian literature.\n        <br/>&emsp;&emsp;\n\n\n        When an author’s writing begins to connect with white, teenage, suburban girls more than the community she claims to represent, there arises a deeply unsettling feeling. What started out as well-meaning work shared amongst Pakistani family & friends had quickly become appropriated by the white masses. Is mass publicity necessarily a bad thing? In short, no. I do, however, think that as writers we need to be careful about the avenues through which our work travels, to how it is reaching our audiences and how they are led to perceive it.\n        </p>\n        <p style ={{textAlign:\"center\"}}> +++ </p>\n        <p>\n        I would like to draw attention to another project that I believe falls prey to creative self-righteousness. Alexandra Leese, a photographer who has shot campaigns and editorials for Helmut Lang, ID, and Self Service Mag, and her most recent project, ‘Boys of Hong Kong’, a collection of portraits of young, male, Hong Kong natives. Leese, who is Chinese British, moved to London from her Hong Kong hometown when she was 11, and briefly returned to Hong Kong for this most recent project, which she talks about in her interview with Office Mag, titled ‘Alex Leese Goes Home’.\n        <br/>&emsp;&emsp;\n\n        The article’s subline remarks about Leese, ‘After moving to London, Leese’s innate fondness for Hong Kong and its culture became tainted by Western Prejudice. However, Boys of Hong Kong is her act of rebellion, and allows her to rise above her learned prejudice.” This is immediately followed by Leese’s comments on how her work addresses the emasculation of Asian men. When asked about her goals for this project, Leese responds,“I wanted to show the world how beautiful Asian men are, and to celebrate this! Quite often, in the West, Asian men are not seen as attractive. I wanted to counter this prejudice by creating and showing a set of portraits that celebrates an incredible range of masculine beauty, from my amazing hometown.”\n        </p>\n        <p>\n\n        It is true that Western media has a history of portraying Asian men as docile, subhuman, and undesirable, but Leese’s comments go to show an ignorance in the twisted narratives she ties her subjects into. In her efforts to ‘rise above her learned prejudice’, she has gone and invaded the youth culture in a disconnected city and portrayed its subjects in an attempt to conform them to western beauty standards. These portraits have been explicitly framed in a western lens, published in western magazines (i-D, Vice), displayed in western galleries (London’s Red Gallery), for primarily western audiences. I am unable to see how this is an attempt to rectify western notions of desirability when it clearly is another eye-candy exhibition of Orientalism.\n        <br/>&emsp;&emsp;\n\n        While the color of your skin may be indicative of your lived experiences, it does not give you a free-pass token to attention-grab when there are more deserving artists. Leese’s portraiture of the male youth in Hong Kong is at most a recreation of other Hong Kong and Chinese photographers such as Liu Wen(@liuwenlw), Wingla Wong (@_vcrs), and Lee Ann Lui (@leanlui), who lived their lives surrounded by Hong Kong and Chinese youth culture, and did not simply ‘return home without a solid plan and explored’ as Leese admitted to doing. This is not the first time Leese’s projects have revolved around Hong Kong residents. In a previous portraiture project titled Hong Kong Taxi Drivers, Leese set out to photograph a group that she was even further disconnected from than her subjects in Boys of Hong Kong.\n        </p>\n        <p style ={{textAlign:\"center\"}}> +++ </p>\n        <p>\n        In Leese’s case, we find an instance of a creative pushed to produce work that will be readily accepted by a Western fanbase. This audience pressure is present for all Asian-American, British-Asian, Asian-Canadian creatives. A famous example can be found within the works and interviews with Kazuo Ishiguro, the Japanese author who was raised in the UK and awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2017. Ishiguro’s debut novel, A Pale View of Hills, follows the murky history of a mother raising her daughter in Japan, but what many readers don’t know is that the novel was first set in Cornwall, and it was only upon the feedback of his classmates that Ishiguro decided the parochial setting would resonate more in Japan. Ishiguro has done an excellent job of explicitly stating his stance on his own identity as a British author, not Japanese or British-Japanese, but a British author who occasionally draws a slight thematic from his childhood and summers spent in Japan. However, despite this firm stance, the public relentlessly pursuits his Japanese origins. In an interview with Electric Lit, Elysha Chang remarks about his most recent novel, the Buried Giant, “I love the way there’s still something Japanese that comes across in its style and tone.” For context, the Buried Giant, follows an elderly couple set in a medieval England fantasy landscape. No matter how far detached Ishiguro’s novels stray from his Japanese roots, his irreversible characters in his name and the never-ending stream of readers who to him, attribute their love of contemporary Japanese, will continue to haunt him for the foreseeable future.\n        <br/>&emsp;&emsp;\n\n        As Asian-American writers, photographers, creatives, and I am specifically referring to a subset of Asian-American, those of us who have grown up our entire lives in a Western country, educated by Western ideals, we need to do better, hold ourselves to a higher standard. It is cheap of us to simply escape to our ‘home’ countries and create projects where we ‘rediscover it with fresh eyes’. Our lived experience like each individual on this planet is undeniably unique and provides us with more than enough content to express ourselves for. When we reduce our work to an attempt to ‘reconnect’ with a disconnected ancestry, it calls for a momentary distancing to think about the lens in which we and our audience perceives our work. If it is an introspective reflection on ourselves, a journey to genuinely reconnect, that reflect that sense of yearning and displacement, then we must find a way to convey it. But if we find that our project is misrepresenting a culture we know despairingly little about and we, another stranger with a camera or a pen profiting off western dreams of orientalism, then we need to do better.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\nimport \"../styles/global.css\";\n\nexport default class HumanHeart extends Component {\n  render(){\n    return(\n      <div>\n        <p>\n          <div style ={{color:\"#e8523f\"}}>\n            <i>Human Heart</i> <br/>\n          </div>\n          <i>Jan 28, 1986, 11:38 AM</i>\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n        Hundreds of students have gathered in the Concord High School auditorium, eyes glued to the tele placed on a black plastic rolling cart. Conversations are shushed as teenagers and faculty alike strain their ears, trying to catch bits and pieces of the static broadcast. The machine is dialed to a CNN live stream, and they chant in tune with the flight operator from Kennedy Space Station. Ten, Nine, Eight…\n        <br/>&emsp;&emsp;\n\n        This is no ordinary space mission. The space shuttle that has just launched, carries one of their own, who they call Mrs. McAuliffe, who only a year and a half prior was standing in the classroom, teaching them about the Battle of Gettysburg, grading their Cold War essays. To the students, she will always be a teacher of many firsts, but now they must share her with the nation as the first teacher to venture into space. As the shuttle launches, the students erupt into cheers, unable to contain their excitement knowing they stand witness to a pivotal moment in history.\n        <br/>&emsp;&emsp;\n\n        At Cape Canaveral, what was once a barren strip of sand and scrubs has long been converted into NASA’s standing base of operations for its space exploration program. Having sent the world's second man into space one month after Russia claimed the golden title, NASA, nearly twenty-five years later, prepared to launch its 25th space mission with destination STS-51-L: a crew of seven aboard the space shuttle Challenger, embarking on its 10th voyage into the unknown.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n        Barbara Morgan stands atop a viewing platform located several miles from the launch site and watches as her fellow teacher and astronaut trainee, hidden somewhere deep in the belly of the beast, behind hundreds of layers of LI-900 silica designed to withstand temperatures of up to 1,260 degrees Celsius, will in moments be propelled into the sky at 18,000 miles per hour. For the past year and a half, they have undergone the same training, learning to fly T-38’s and do barrel rolls and lazy eights, performing underwater stimulations in full gear close to 300 lbs. In some buried corner of her heart she wishes that she was the one aboard the Challenger, the nation’s eyes watching her, but tells herself regardless of whether or not she makes it to space, the journey has already brought her so many experiences that she can’t wait to share back in McCall with her students and family.\n        <br/>&emsp;&emsp;\n\n        It seemed only yesterday that she was interviewing for NASA’s Teacher in Space Program (TISP). When president Ronald Reagan had broadcasted plans for TISP on national television, Barbara, along with many other teachers across the nation, had jumped out of her seat and exclaimed, “That’s a great idea!” After receiving news that she had made it to the semifinalist round, she spent many nights drafting plans and rehearsing what she would say during her interview. She looked in the mirror and maintained eye contact, “The thing I want everyone to remember is, I’m not going to be the only private citizen in space, I’m planning on taking the whole country with me.” Her reflection nodded and flashed a coy grin. Perfect.\n        <br/>&emsp;&emsp;\n\n        Christa sat in the cockpit of the space shuttle, Challenger. Despite over a year of training, she still felt like she was not fully prepared for what was about to happen. Going through the ‘vomit comet’, a small appetizer of weightless euphoria quickly followed by intense nausea experienced during the KC-135’s nosedive, was one thing, but a full-fledged launch was a whole different animal. The press that led up to the mission had propelled Christa into national stardom. The other day, when a waitress asked for her autograph, it reminded Christa of writing a hall pass for her students during their break period.12 Judith, the mission specialist, checks the external tank ullage pressure, then the SSME supply helium pressure, “right engine helium tank is a bit low.” She thinks about her oldest, Scott, and her youngest, Caroline and wishes that she spent more time with them this past year. It gives her strength knowing that they are watching her, hundreds of miles away, along with the rest of the nation. When they came to tour the space station and met the astronauts, Caroline had told her she liked the cafeteria’s tuna fish sandwiches, while Scott liked the batting cages down the road. She closes her eyes and silently vows to make her daughter a tuna fish sandwich first thing when she returned to Concord. The NASA flight-control countdown is reaching its end and she hears Judith say, “Aaalll right” followed by Mike, the pilot, “Here we go.” She braced herself as the air rushed towards her, facing the mouth of an open lion as it roars, the impact the throttle of a steam locomotive.\n\n        And then it launches.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n\n        Among a crowd of viewers Barbara claps her hands in excitement. It is a perfect afternoon, blue skies not a single cloud in sight. As the Challenger rises in the air, painting a thick brushstroke of smoke, she waves at her departing friend, “Bye Christa, bye crew…see you later!” The winds whip against her face and stirs her hair, but her eyes are transfixed on the rocket that is rising higher…higher…higher until it hurts to crane her neck further in its backwards arc. She shouts one final, “bye” into the air, hoping it will reach her friends, already separated by tens of thousands of miles within the span of seconds.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        T+73 seconds.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        The students inside the auditorium continue to cheer well past blastoff. Challenger is once again heading into space, but this time with Mrs. McAuliffe aboard. It was like the whole room was travelling into space with her. On the screen, CNN correspondent Tom Mintier is saying something, NASA…delays…, but the noise drowns out the broadcast. The spaceship travels in a diagonal trajectory, piercing a hole through an unconveyed plane on the two-dimensional screen. The raster scan projects electron screams of reds, greens, blues converging into a firework of flaming-copper clouds. The students continue to cheer. Tom stops mid-sentence, but no one notices amidst the noise. The camera zooms out to reveal a sentence of smoke ending in an em dash eruption, then a two-pronged split in diverging directions like bull horns rushing towards then away then into a maddening spiral. And then it is death, silence. “An explosion”, says Tom, describing only what he can see, unable to place the horror of an entire nation into words.\n        <br/>&emsp;&emsp;\n\n        Barbara watches as her friend drops from the sky like an angel stripped of her wings. The falling debris leaves thin wobbling streaks in their wake, an unsteady hand against a blue canvas. Behind her, nameless faces voice their concerns, “that’s not right… that’s not right… that’s not right at all.” Then they are moving, rushing off the platform, searching for someone who can tell them it will be all right. That the explosion looked worse than it actually was. That Christa would walk out of the wrecked hull that landed somewhere over the Atlantic with her hair-singed and in a scratchy, shaking voice tell her to stop crying. The viewing platform is now empty, I can no longer see Morgan, only the steaming evidence of the Challenger’s 73 second journey into orbit, already dispersing into the afternoon air. The video of Morgan was received by NASA from a 3/4” videotape under the Freedom of Information Act, never to be broadcasted to the public.\n        <br/>&emsp;&emsp;\n\n        A few days before the Challenger was set to launch, a crowd of reporters, wearing button-down shirts, suits and blazers, carrying bulky camera equipment, line up in a long L around the crewmembers of STS-51-L, who don NASA jumpsuits, the color of the evening sky. They have followed the astronauts to Kennedy Space Station, each one prepared to address their audience with a brief remark on the upcoming journey. Ron McNair, one of three mission specialists aboard the crew of seven, introduces Christa, who walks up to the microphone, long accustomed to speeches and the press, delivers a monologue with the slight air of hometown charm and superficiality that pulls on the nation’s heartstrings.\n        <br/>&emsp;&emsp;\n\n        “We watched Columbia go over the Houston area this morning and that was a thrill.”\n        <br/>&emsp;&emsp;\n\n        As she speaks, her eyes dart away from the cameras for a second towards the sky, exposing a fleeting smile. How could she know that in seventeen years from now, as the Columbia began its descent back into earth’s atmosphere, a piece of foam insulation would break off and strike the left wing of the orbiter leaving the spacecraft to disintegrate into a flaming comet? It would be NASA’s second fatal operation, following only the infamous Challenger that she was so excited to board, still standing in one piece and waiting to make history in only a few days. Christa would make it only 46,000 feet in the air, barely breaching the stratosphere, a far distance from her planned escape from orbit.\n        <br/>&emsp;&emsp;\n\n        President Ronald Reagan, in his speech honoring the Teacher in Space Program (TISP) finalists, cracks a joke to an audience, easy to please in the presence of the nation’s most important figurehead. “I also want to tell you that your shuttle doesn’t blast off for a while yet, so there’s still time to back out.”9 The audience laughs and the finalists smile. Barbara hopes that President Reagan’s remarks are directed at herself, still ignorant of the prophecy to be carved in the face of one of the nation’s greatest tragedies. For Barbara, that shuttle would blast off much later than she could have possibly imagined, in fact, it would be over twenty years until she prepared to board the Endeavor on mission on STS-118, and pick up the torch of her fallen comrade to become the nation’s first teacher in space. But by then, no one seems to care except those whose memories of Jan 28, 1986 play on an infinite loop in their dreams, a bruise that never seems to heal. When asked about Christa during her prefight interview, Barbara says, “Christa was, is, and always will be our teacher in space, the first teacher to fly.”\n        <br/>&emsp;&emsp;\n\n        Later, the public would find out that the Challenger’s explosion was due to O-ring malfunctions, rubber rings used to connect different sections of the shuttle’s solid rocket boosters, failure to form a seal, allowing hot gas to leak through, ultimately leading to the explosion of several liquid hydrogen tanks. In hindsight, investigations uncovered that the O-ring’s were an issue brought up several times before and highlighted NASA’s irresponsibility bypassing underlying safety checks. NASA confirmed that at least three of the astronauts survived the initial break-apart, as indicated by the activation of the shuttles Personal Egress Air Packs, but with no evacuation protocols in place, they could only wait for their freefall to conclude.1 When the cabin impacted with the Atlantic at over 200 mph, no one could survive the crushing force of over 200 G’s. What was left of the shuttle was instantly crushed, including the astronauts inside.\n        <br/>&emsp;&emsp;\n\n        TISP was supposed to be only the first step in a series that would lead to the America’s dream of civilian space travel. In 1986, three weeks before the Challenger lifts off, John Noble Wilford of The New York Times writes, “NASA expects to include private citizens on other flights to communicate the space experience from nontechnical perspectives…In time, poets, painters, laborers, musicians and others will get to fly.” At the time, NASA was already accepting applications from journalists for a trip the following Fall.9 The Challenger accident brought dreams of an egalitarian space to a halt. Instead of the straw breaking the camel’s back, it was more like a fleet of F-16 bombers. It would be three years until NASA flew its next space operation. Even today, nearly thirty-five years later, dreams of civilian space-travel have not been realized.\n        <br/>&emsp;&emsp;\n\n        When I ask my friends about the teacher in space mission, or the Challenger, few know what I am talking about or only have vague notions of the incident. In the span of over three decades, the tragedy has been buried under the weight of history. Many of McAuliffe’s former students have gone on to become teachers themselves. Scott Reynolds, a 1987 alumnus who now teaches science at St. Paul’s in Concord, brings his students to a local cemetery each year to conduct an exercise linking deaths to wars and diseases. As the school bus drives by McAuliffe’s gravestone, he asks his students if they know who she is, who she was. Among his class of nearly thirty, there is always one, one who remembers.\n        <br/>&emsp;&emsp;\n\n        In Emilia Kai Bock’s 2010 documentary, Human Heart, I watch Claire Boucher, more commonly known by her stage name, Grimes, peel a photograph of McAuliffe off her refrigerator. “Who is she?”, Bock asks Boucher. “I forget her name, she was a grade three teacher who died on… Challenger?”, Boucher tentatively responds. “I don’t know, I just think it…I just love this color of blue.” Boucher points to McAuliffe’s jumpsuit, the same one she wore during the crew press release I watched. She flips the photograph over. On the back, words written in black sharpie sprawl in a child’s handwriting: yesterday’s dreams R 2morrows Rainbows. Boucher stares at the words, “It just somehow seems so…yeah.” I sense a feeling of sadness that lies behind her voice. The camera zooms in on McAuliffe’s face. “She’s dead”, Boucher says.\n        <br/>&emsp;&emsp;\n\n        During Morgan’s preflight interview, she said, “Christa’s saying was, I touch the future, I teach.”3 Watching Boucher with her photograph of McAuliffe and unable to understand my own obsessions with the Challenger mission, I begin to think that McAuliffe’s message holds truer than she could have known. While she never did make it to space, I believe that her story finds those who need it, who continue to learn from it. Sitting on my couch, listening to Oblivion, Grimes’s 2012 single off her album Visions, I feel like I can hear a bit of McAuliffe beyond the veil of ephemera and synthesizers, reaching out to me from a planet far, far away.\n\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\nimport NavBar from \"../components/navbar.js\"\nimport SideBar from \"../components/sidebar.js\"\nimport PhotoEssay from \"../text/photo-essay.js\"\nimport NFTEssay from \"../text/nft-essay.js\"\nimport AAEssay from \"../text/aa-essay.js\"\nimport HumanHeart from \"../text/human-heart.js\"\nimport { BsChevronLeft, BsChevronRight } from \"react-icons/bs\";\nimport \"../styles/global.css\";\n\nexport default class TextPage extends Component {\n  constructor(props){\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {content: <PhotoEssay/>, title: \"escaping the frame\", expand: false}\n    this.switchText = this.switchText.bind(this)\n    this.expandSideBar = this.expandSideBar.bind(this)\n  }\n\n  switchText(clickContent,clickTitle){\n    this.setState({content: clickContent, title:clickTitle});\n    console.log(this.state.content);\n    this.forceUpdate();\n  }\n\n  expandSideBar(){\n    this.setState(prevState => ({\n      expand: !prevState.expand\n    }));\n  }\n  render(){\n    const textlist = [\n      {\n        title: \"escaping the frame\",\n        content: <PhotoEssay/>,\n      },\n      {\n        title: \"does anyone still care about nfts?\",\n        content: <NFTEssay/>,\n      },\n      {\n        title: \"human heart\",\n        content: <HumanHeart/>\n      },\n      {\n        title: \"a thin line\",\n        content: <AAEssay/>\n      },\n\n    ];\n    const content = this.state.content;\n    const title = this.state.title;\n    const expand = this.state.expand;\n    let arrow;\n    if (expand==true) {\n      arrow = <BsChevronLeft className = \"expand-arrow\"/>;\n    } else {\n      arrow = <BsChevronRight className = \"expand-arrow\"/>;\n    }\n    return(\n      <main>\n        <div className={expand==false ? \"expand-sideBar\": \"collapse-sideBar\"} onClick = {this.expandSideBar}>\n  \n        </div>\n        <div className = \"cssgrid\">\n          <div className ={expand==true ? \"expand-sideBar-bg\": \"none\"}>\n            <div className={expand==false ? \"text-sideBar\": \"expand-text\"}>\n              {textlist.map((item)=>{\n                return (\n                  <div className = {expand==true ? \"expand-list-item\" : \"none\"}>\n                    <a onClick={()=>this.switchText(item.content, item.title)} style ={{color: item.title==this.state.title ?
